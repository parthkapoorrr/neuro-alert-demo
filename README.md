ðŸ§  NeuroAlert: An HRV-Based Epileptic Seizure Prediction System

NeuroAlert is a proof-of-concept prototype developed for a 7-day hackathon. It is a software-based system that analyzes Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biomarkers to predict the onset of an epileptic seizure minutes in advance, providing a life-saving warning.

This project is built on the medical hypothesis that the pre-ictal phaseâ€”a distinct period 10-20 minutes before a seizureâ€”is marked by significant dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). These changes are subtle but measurable in HRV data.

ðŸ“ˆ Final Model Performance (V7)

This prototype proves the hypothesis is viable. The final model analyzes 36 temporal features (10-minute trends, volatility, and slope) derived from 12 core HRV biomarkers.

Recall (Sensitivity): ~71%

Correctly detected 24 out of 34 oncoming seizures in the test data.

Precision: ~2%

To achieve high sensitivity, the model generates a high number of false positives.

Accuracy: 82%

The model is highly accurate in identifying normal brain states.

Model: EasyEnsembleClassifier

An advanced model specifically designed to handle extreme 158:1 class imbalance.

The high recall demonstrates a successful proof-of-concept. The low precision is a known trade-off, which would be the primary focus of future R&D (e.g., by adding EEG features).

ðŸš€ How to Run the Prototype

This project is a Streamlit dashboard that simulates the NeuroAlert system in real-time.

1. Setup:

# Clone the repository
git clone [your-github-repo-url]
cd NeuroAlert_App

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt



2. Run the App:

streamlit run app.py



3. Run the Simulation:

The app will open in your browser.

Upload the neuroalert_final_dataset_v2.csv file when prompted.

Click the "Start Real-Time Simulation" button.

Watch the dashboard as the model analyzes each 2-minute segment, calculates 10-minute trends, and raises alerts when it detects a pre-ictal pattern.

This prototype was developed by Rijjul Garg (Medical Lead) andÂ Parth Kapoor (Tech Lead).
