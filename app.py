        An epileptic seizure is not an instant event. For many patients, it is preceded by a distinct physiological state

        heart rate and breathing, becomes dysregulated.

        Instead of trying to detect the seizure in the brain (with EEG), our approach is to detect the *body's reaction* to the pre-ictal phase. We do this by analyzing **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** from a simple ECG signal.
        
        HRV is not just the heart rate, but the tiny, millisecond-level variations *between* heartbeats. A healthy
        heart is not a perfect metronome; it has high variability. During the pre-ictal phase, this variability
        changes in predictable ways.
        
        **Our model was trained on 12 key HRV-derived biomarkers:**
        - **Time-Domain:** MeanNN, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50
        - **Frequency-Domain:** LF/HF ratio
        - **Non-Linear (PoincarÃ©):** SD1, SD2, SD1/SD2 ratio, CSI, HRV_HTI
        - **Entropy:** SampEn
        - **Basic:** Heart Rate (HR)
        
        By feeding these 12 biomarkers from 2-minute windows of ECG data into an XGBoost machine learning model,
        NeuroAlert learns the complex "signature" of the pre-ictal phase.
